In quiet hours, when dawn is near,
And morning mists begin to clear,
The world is still, the sky is pale,
The earth exhales a silver veil.

The trees stand tall, yet softly sway,
To whispers that the winds convey.
Each leaf a note, each breeze a song,
A hymn of peace we've known all along.

The sun peeks through with golden grace,
And kisses gently nature’s face.
The dew upon the blades of green
Reflects a world serene, unseen.

The river flows without a sound,
Its wisdom older than the ground.
It speaks of time, of things once passed,
Of moments slow and running fast.

A bird will cry, a branch will bend,
Yet all things heal, and all things mend.
The clouds may form a looming doubt,
But light, in time, will break them out.

So too, the mind—so full, so wide—
A thousand thoughts it holds inside.
But silence is a sacred space,
Where one can breathe, and dreams find place.

And in that hush, we come to know,
That even storms will cease to blow.
That pain gives birth to kinder ways,
And darkest nights to brightest days.

We chase and climb, we fall, we rise,
We count our scars beneath the skies.
But every mark and every trial,
Becomes a story worth the mile.

So take this moment, hold it still,
Forget the rush, release the will.
Let all your worries drift like foam—
You're not alone. You're always home.
